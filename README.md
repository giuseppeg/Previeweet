# Previeweet

Previeweet is browser extension which provides Twitter users with small image previews to the right of tweets.

## Warning

The plugin's codebase is old and bad. Meanwhile Twitter has introduced a new JS framework for its profiles and other pages.
At the moment Previeweet works only for the homepage/mainstream/timeline/whateveryoucall it.

I am planning to rewrite it from scratch somewhere in the future. I am studing a beautified version of the Twitter's profiles.js. Due to the minification it is an hard job. So if someone would like to contribute/help, please do it!

## HOWTO use it


Download the Chrome-extension: http://previeweet.com
